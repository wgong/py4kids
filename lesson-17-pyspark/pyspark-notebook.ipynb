    "## Spark SQL and Data Frames\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce Spark capabilities to deal with data in a structured way. Basically, everything turns around the concept of *Data Frame* and using *SQL language* to query them. We will see how the data frame abstraction, very popular in other data analytics ecosystems (e.g. R and Python/Pandas), it is very powerful when performing exploratory data analysis. In fact, it is very easy to express data queries when used together with the SQL language. Moreover, Spark distributes this column-based data structure transparently, in order to make the querying process as efficient as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting a Data Frame\n",
    "\n",
    "A Spark `DataFrame` is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or a data frame in R or Pandas. They can be constructed from a wide array of sources such as a existing RDD in our case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entry point into all SQL functionality in Spark is the `SQLContext` class. To create a basic instance, all we need is a `SparkContext` reference. Since we are running Spark in shell mode (using pySpark) we can use the global context object `sc` for this purpose.  "

    "\n",
    "With a `SQLContext`, we are ready to create a `DataFrame` from our existing RDD. But first we need to tell Spark SQL the schema in our data.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark SQL can convert an RDD of `Row` objects to a `DataFrame`. Rows are constructed by passing a list of key/value pairs as *kwargs* to the `Row` class. The keys define the column names, and the types are inferred by looking at the first row. Therefore, it is important that there is no missing data in the first row of the RDD in order to properly infer the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we first need to split the comma separated data, and then use the information in KDD's 1999 task description to obtain the [column names](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup.names).  \n",

    "The previous dataframe showed us which variables are highly correlated. We have kept just those variables with at least one strong correlation. We can use as we please, but a good way could be to do some model selection. That is, if we have a group of variables that are highly correlated, we can keep just one of them to represent the group under the assumption that they convey similar information as predictors. Reducing the number of variables will not improve our model accuracy, but it will make it easier to understand and also more efficient to compute.  \n",

    "For example, from the description of the [KDD Cup 99 task](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/task.html) we know that the variable `dst_host_same_src_port_rate` references the percentage of the last 100 connections to the same port, for the same destination host. In our correlation matrix (and auxiliar dataframes) we find that this one is highly and positively correlated to `src_bytes` and `srv_count`. The former is the number of bytes sent form source to destination. The later is the number of connections to the same service as the current connection in the past 2 seconds. We might decide not to include `dst_host_same_src_port_rate` in our model if we include the other two, as a way to reduce the number of variables and later one better interpret our models.  \n",
