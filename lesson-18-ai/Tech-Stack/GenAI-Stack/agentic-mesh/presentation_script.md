# Agentic Mesh Architecture Presentation Script
*1-2 minute presentation for management*

---

**[Opening - Point to the People-Product-Process circle]**

"Our vision is simple: use AI to intelligently connect people, products, and processes across our organization. Today, I want to show you how we can scale our proven GenAI success into an enterprise-wide agentic mesh."

**[Point to green boxes in the diagram]**

"We've already proven this works. Our Developer Assist chatbot successfully integrates access management, Jira, product management, and DevOps - streamlining the entire software development lifecycle. But this is just the beginning."

**[Gesture across the persona layer]**

"This architecture shows how we expand beyond developers to product managers, security analysts, data analysts, and business analysts - each with their own specialized AI assistants, but all sharing the same robust foundation."

**[Point to the protocol layer]**

"Here's what makes this future-proof: we're building on emerging open standards. Think of MCP as the USB connector for AI tools, ACP as the HTTP for agent communication, and A2A as the workflow engine for agent collaboration. No vendor lock-in, maximum flexibility."

**[Point to common services]**

"The beauty of this federated approach is that each domain team owns their AI agents and workflows, while we provide shared services for authentication, governance, and observability. It's the data mesh principle applied to AI."

**[Closing - back to the circle]**

"The result? An intelligent nervous system for our organization where AI agents work together to accelerate every business process. We have the foundation, we have the roadmap, and we have the standards. The question is: are we ready to lead in the age of agentic AI?"
