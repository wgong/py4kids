# Cache Tools in Python

Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area (cache) to improve performance and reduce latency. In Python, there are several libraries available for caching, such as `cachetools`, `functools.lru_cache`, and `requests-cache`.

## Example: Using `cachetools` with TTL (Time-To-Live)

```bash
pip install cachetools requests beautifulsoup4
```

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
# Run multiple calls within 60 seconds
result1 = download_data()  # Cache MISS
result2 = download_data()  # Cache HIT (same fetched_at timestamp)

# Wait over 60 seconds, then:
result3 = download_data()  # Cache MISS (new fetched_at timestamp)
```
