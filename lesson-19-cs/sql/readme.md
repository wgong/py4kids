## Lessons
L1. Hello World
L2. Big O
L3. Problem Solving
L4. Coding
L5. Verification
L6. Communication
L7. Coding
L8. SQL



### L2 
Big O is the language engineers use to describe an algorithm's efficiency. 
Are our optimizations helping or hurting? They allow us to tackle this question without a timer. Before your interview, make sure you have an excellent understanding of Big O for both time and space.

Tips:
- Include all things
- use logical vars
- adding vs multiplying
- drop constants
- drop non-dominant terms 
- consider both time and space complexity

### L3
#### 7 Problem solving steps
- Listen carefully for clues
- Draw an example
- brute force (stupid way of solving the problem)
- optimize
- walk thru algo (have the mental map) 
- Code 
- verify and debug
 
#### Problem Solving - Optimizing with BUD
Bottlenecks
Unnecessary work 
Duplicate work 

#### Optimizing with Space and Time
space-time trade-off: use space to gain time
hash table
pre-processing: 
best conceivable runtime

####  Optimizing with DIY
similar to brute-force way

### L4. Coding
- talk about how to solve it/approach, design, 
- walk thru it for interviewer 

- Signal not perfection:
	- readability
	- correctness
	- performance
	- maintainability

- Wait until you are ready to code 
- Wait until your interviewer is ready to code 

- Prepare:
	- docstring 
	- In/out
	- helpers
	- index

- ok to use lang-specific features

- use good style 
- write well-structured code 

- think about edge cases , error handling
- modularize code top-down, filling in the next functions as needed

- ignore things that don't show good signal , Focus on what show signals


#### L5. Verification

- conceptual walk-thru 
- hot spots where are the high-risk lines of code
- test cases
- edge cases 


#### L6. Communication

Speaking and Listening
- drive thru the Problem
- show your thought process 
- ask questions 
- use examples to explain your approach 
- be open about mistakes 
- keep trying! don't give up (which is a bad attitude)
- listen and pay attention to interviewer

 
#### L7. Coding

#### L8. SQL
