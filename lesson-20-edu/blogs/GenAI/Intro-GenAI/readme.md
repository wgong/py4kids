# AI Slide: **Intro to GenAI**
use GLM 4.5 by ZhiPu to create slide deck via its "AI Slides" feature

see [GLM 4.5 chat history](https://chat.z.ai/c/c8c38c23-5d3b-48fe-a018-22e5861ecefa)

## Prompt

```
in late Nov of 2024, I gave a talk on Intro to GenAI, see PDF here https://github.com/wgong/py4kids/blob/master/lesson-20-edu/blogs/GenAI/EOA-seminar/docs/GenAI-Intro.pdf
can you review its content, love to hear your feedback?
the timing of that talk is right before DeepSeek moment, we know lots of progress have been made, 
For example, I view GLM 4.5 is another "deepseek moment" in achieving overall LLM performance in terms of 
searching, coding, thinking, reasoning integration.  
Can you create a new slide deck to teach students about "Introduction to GenAI" as of today
continue using HTML pages for slides, I will run your navigation python script to create the overall slide app which allow one to navigate among all the pages locally
