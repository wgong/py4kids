- [Meet the Real Isaac Newton They Never Told You About | The Economics of Empire - Prof Jiang Explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVHeSvAeiTU)


Isaac Newton is remembered as the father of modern science — but the real Newton was far stranger and more powerful than most people realize.

In this lecture, Prof. Jiang explains the three shocking sides of Newton’s life:

Newton the occultist, obsessed with alchemy and prophecy.

Newton the theologian, who saw his laws of motion as proof of God’s existence and laid the foundation for Christian Zionism.

Newton the spymaster, who ran Britain’s first intelligence network as Master of the Royal Mint.

These hidden sides of Newton reveal how his ideas shaped secret societies, Christian Zionism, the Anglo-American Empire, and even the creation of Israel.

If you want to understand the real forces driving history — theology, empire, finance, and prophecy — this is a talk you won’t want to miss.
